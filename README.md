SharpMC
=======
This is my test project, currently in heavy development.<Br>
The code is pretty **** messy. But oh well, it works :P<br>
Hopefully i'll get more work done soon :)<br>
I'm developing all of this on Mac os X using Xamarin Studio.<br>
As i am using a mac, i use Mono. So i try to make everything work on Mono right away.<Br>
If something doesn't work on Mono, i try to fix it a different way :)<Br>
